Subject: Fix building with use_bluez=false

This is a quick and dirty fix for building electron with use_bluez=false
It prevents initialization and usage of Bluetooth by electron
It is not supposed to be applied for use_bluez=true
It may affect electron's power management capabilities
disable-bluez.patch should be also applied
